Name: Johnny Nguyen
StudentID: 101185885

## Description

ExpressJS Health & Fitness Management System Application that simulates an application where members, trainers, and staff are able to communicate, coordinate, and track their fitness and manage schedules/classes.


## Instruction to run

1. Install dependencies using npm: `npm install`
2. Run application `npx nodemon app-server.js`

### Status

Incomplete - Unfortunately I have not been able to fully complete this application, as a result here is the only functionality that has been implemented thus far:
    - getAllMembers - GET request that returns a table of all members in the database
    - setProfile - GET request that returns a table of the updated member relation
